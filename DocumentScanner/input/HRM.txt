The DishList component in React manages and displays a list of dishes fetched from a backend API 
using getAllDishes. It uses useState to maintain the list of dishes in its local state and useEffect to fetch 
data when the component mounts. Each dish is rendered using the DishItem component, which includes
 functionality to toggle its publish status via togglePublishStatus. When a dish's publish status changes, 
the list is refreshed to reflect the updated data, ensuring the UI remains synchronized with the backend.
 Overall, DishList provides a clear and interactive interface for viewing and managing dishes in a Reac
t application.
The getAllDishes function imports an array of dishes from a JSON file and returns a Promise
 that resolves with the current state of these dishes. This simulates fetching data asynchronously,
 useful for displaying initial dish information in the application.

On the other hand, the togglePublishStatus function toggles the publish status of a
 dish identified by its dishId. It modifies the local dishes array by mapping through each
 dish and toggling its isPublished property when the dishId matches. This function returns 
a Promise resolved immediately after updating the state, mimicking an update operation in
 a real backend scenario.

Question 1: Convert a given number to words (Range 999 crores)
Set Matrix Zeroes 
 Implement LRU cache using suitable data structures 
Detect loop in a Linked List
The first question was to remove every 5th element from a map. 
The 3rd question was a variation of the classic pattern searching in a string.
 I told him the brute force solution and then the most optimized approach (i.e. using
 KMP Algorithm).
